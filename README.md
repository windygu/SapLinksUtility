# SapLinksUtility
Initial publish
The end result of this project will be a Windows desktop application in which I can store technical information
about SAP applications and related data. From this repository of information I will be able to automatically
generate a series of html web pages that can be used by others to browse information for various SAP systems
or click relevant URL links for SAP systems. I will be also able to automatically generate the saprouttab
table and saplogon.ini and sapmsg.ini files. I plan on making this utility program a "data driven" application
where data contained in flat files will determine how the program operates. The core files will contain a
basic data repository defining all of the fields, files, relationships, and constraints. These in turn will
drive the input/output, editing, and validation routines.
